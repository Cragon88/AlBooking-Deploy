The interns were placed in different divisions of IIV’s partner companies, receiving on-the-job training and mentorship from a firm supervisor. This ideology of giving the interns first hand experience during their internship enhanced IIV’s quality as an internship provider in Vietnam, and also a close model to professional internships in New York or London. In addition, an emphasis on the “giving back to society” spirit was also put forward. Every intern was required to work on a community project of their own, contributing through volunteerism and leadership.",

      "Since 2007 when he first met with management teams in Vietnam as an investor, Tony Ngo has observed the need and potential for talented young leaders to shape the trajectory of Vietnam's development. In 2009, Tony founded 'Interns in Vietnam' (IIV) to develop leaders who will not only succeed on an individual level, but will also make a difference by driving business, economic, and social changes in their communities.",
      "IIV is predicated on cultivating professional development and leadership skills, and IIV’s first initiative achieves this through a summer internship program that connects high-achieving students with opportunities in Vietnam. The initial program successfully placed five students at Horizon Capital and IDG Ventures Vietnam in the summer of 2009.",
      "In 2010, IIV partnered with Sponsors for Educational Opportunity (SEO), a U.S based non-profit organization that provides educational and career programs to young people from underserved communities, to form SEO-Vietnam. In its first year, SEO-Vietnam received over 180 applications and successfully placed 13 students in 7 firms at several prestigious financial services, retail, and non-profit organizations in Vietnam. The program also expanded to include rigorous training, mentorship and a Summer Seminar Series that featured executives and leaders in business, government and non-profit organizations."
